Loose fruit collection was satisfactory. There is a slight shortage of harvesters (24 available out of 28 required). Infield collection using Mechanical Badang (MB) achieved the highest productivity (9.29 MT/day). Pruning progress is up-to-date, with progressive pruning successfully implemented and acceptable canopy management standards (36-40 fronds). Premature snapping of fronds was observed in blocks P06A, P09B, and P10C, attributed to Ganoderma infection. Palm vigor was generally acceptable, but some palms in laterite areas exhibited mild magnesium and potassium deficiency symptoms. Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus levels declined in P06A. Water-logging conditions were not detected. Weeding program for 2024 was completed without significant delays except for P06A (70% for third round circle weeding).

FFB were left overnight in P15G-04. Loose fruit collection is generally acceptable but oxidized loose fruit found in hilly areas. Palm appearance is acceptable, but retarded growth and small bunch formation observed in laterite areas and areas previously overgrown by weeds (P15G-03). Pruning is progressing well in 2025, but under-pruning was observed in PM03C-01. Pre-mature frond snapping in PM05E-01 and PM05E-02. Frond heap management is inconsistent. Weeding program is behind schedule for circle spraying, with over-spraying in E02 and G01. Undesirable weeds (Giant Paspalum, Clidemia hirta, Bamboo, woody vegetation, Stenochlaena, Bracken ferns, VOPs) are present. Rat damage is minimal, but a full census is needed.

                        "Blocking System": "The blocking system remains unchanged with a total area of 2809.16 ha. A tentative replanting programme for 2025-2027 is in place. The palm census in P96D showed a 6% decrease in palm stand, highlighting the need to expand the census to other blocks.",
                        "Nutrient Inputs & Progress of Manuring": "Manuring progress is at 81% completion for the year, which is slightly behind schedule. Delays of up to 3 months were noted for some programs, which is undesirable for immature plantings. The estate is advised to complete remaining programs promptly.",
                        "Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) Application": "As of October 2024, 54,179.43 MT of EFB has been applied over 70% of the targeted area. Application quality needs improvement, as EFB is often placed too close to the palm base, which can lead to VOP growth and hinder loose fruit collection.",
                        "Agronomic Observations": "Harvesting intervals exceeded 20 days in most fields due to a shortage of skilled harvesters, impacting crop quality with over-ripe bunches observed. Pruning is satisfactory in most blocks but under-pruned in P96C and P96D. Palm appearance is generally acceptable, with some mild potassium deficiency. Weeding for inter-rows is on schedule, but circle weeding is slow.",
                        "Pest & Disease Control": "Rat damage is under control with an average infestation of 3.8%. Barn owl occupancy is at 63%, but many boxes are in poor condition. Bagworm treatment (trunk injection) was conducted in August 2024, and palms are showing recovery. Ganoderma infection remains negligible.",
                        "Yield Performance": "As of October 2024, the average yield increased by 22% compared to the same period in 2023. However, performance in older plantings (P96B, C, D) was below expectations due to incomplete crop recovery. Cumulative harvesting rounds averaged 66% of the target.",
                        "Fertilizer Recommendations for 2025": "The 2025 fertilizer program has been formulated. Manuring is to be withdrawn for blocks scheduled for felling. EFB will be treated as a supplement. The programme must be strictly followed."

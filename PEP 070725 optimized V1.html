The manuring program for 2024 was incomplete and 2025 progress is slow. Crop recovery is unsatisfactory due to prolonged harvesting intervals and incomplete loose fruit collection, leading to significant over-ripe bunches. Palm nutrient status is suboptimal, and pruning remains a major issue. Weed control is slow, and rat infestation is high with insufficient baiting.","Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring":"Only 67% of the 2024 manuring program was completed due to flooding and late deliveries (Agronomy Report, Pg. 11). As of March 2025, only 5% of the first half's program is complete. The fertilizer store has a leaking roof, risking quality (Agronomy Report, Pg. 13). Expediting application is crucial.","Agronomic Observation":"Harvesting intervals exceeded 15 days in 2024, leading to poor crop recovery and over-ripe/rotten bunches (Agronomy Report, Pg. 25). Palm appearance is unsatisfactory, especially in peat soil areas, with yellowing and premature frond snapping. Pruning is significantly behind schedule (only 1% completed in Feb 2025). Weed control is slow, with undesirable grasses and broadleaf weeds present. High rat damage (over 10% in many blocks) with insufficient baiting and poor barn owl box maintenance (Agronomy Report, Pg. 43).","Yield Performance":"Yield in 2024 increased by 1% compared to the previous year but remains below the regional trend. For Jan-Feb 2025, yield improved by 22% compared to last year, though PM05C and PM05D declined. Low production is due to extended harvesting intervals (65% of target rounds achieved) and harvester shortage (1.10-1.40 MT/md productivity). Incomplete fertilizer programs and low average bunch weight (11.05 kg) are also limiting factors (Agronomy Report, Pg. 48).","Fertilizer Recommendation":"No amendments to the 2025 fertilizer program. The estate is advised to expedite application immediately after the rainy season and ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging."},"plantation":{"Executive Summary":"PSK Estate is facing a critical shortage of harvesters and sprayers, leading to high turnover due to low wages. The manuring program is significantly delayed, and there's a substantial backlog in pruning. Harvester productivity is low, and the Vehicle Running Account records require immediate correction.","Area Statement":"The total mature planted area is 1,999.83 ha, with 0.00 ha immature. There has been no change in the area statement, and no replanting is scheduled for 2025.","Labour Statement":"There is a critical shortage of 12 harvesters (actual ratio 1:29 ha vs 1:25 ha required) and 4 sprayers. High turnover is attributed to low harvesting rates. 16 out of 23 new recruits left the estate (PA Report, Pg. 51)."}},"policy":" <div class='policy-item'><p class='font-semibold'>Harvester Productivity & Crop Recovery</p><p class='text-sm text-gray-600'><b>Policy 12.6:</b> Maintain high harvesting standards; collect all loose fruits.

Manuring program for 2023 was completed, but delays occurred in 2024 due to rain/flooding and late deliveries. EFB application is uneven. Harvesting was severely delayed in Division B early 2024 due to heavy floods, leading to substantial crop loss. Pruning is generally satisfactory but with slight under-pruning in various blocks. Ground vegetation is satisfactory in most areas, but incomplete eradication of undesirable weeds and VOPs is observed. Barn owl occupancy is very low, and rat damage is high in some areas.","Nutrient Inputs/Application of Biowaste":"Manuring program for 2023 was fully completed. As of June 2024, Division A completed 61% and Division B 53% of their programs. Delays were caused by rain interference and flooding (Jan-Mar 2024) and late fertilizer deliveries (Agronomy Report, Pg. 19). Fertilizer was applied during monsoon in Dec 2023, risking wastage. EFB application is unevenly distributed and is considered supplementary (Agronomy Report, Pg. 23).","Agronomic Observation":"Harvesting was badly delayed in Division B early 2024 due to heavy floods, leading to substantial crop loss (Agronomy Report, Pg. 32). Harvesting intervals were extended (over 20 days in many Div B blocks, average 42 days for Juasa B in Dec 2024). Crop recovery is less than satisfactory with 5-10% over-ripe bunches. Pruning progress for 2nd round (July 2024) was 78% in Div A and 81% in Div B, with slight under-pruning observed in several blocks (Agronomy Report, Pg. 41). Ground vegetation is generally satisfactory, but undesirable weeds (Clidemia hirta, Stenochlaena, Dicranopteris) and VOPs are present and require complete eradication (Agronomy Report, Pg. 52). Rat damage is high in some blocks, but baiting is insufficient, and barn owl occupancy is very low (15%). Flooding and peat soils emphasize the need for effective water/soil drainage management (Agronomy Report, Pg. 14, 16, 47).","Yield Performance":"Overall 2024 yield performance increased by 1% compared to the previous year but still below potential. For Juasa A & B combined, yield achieved till Dec 2024 was 14.48 MT/ha, 7% below budget. Low production is attributed to extended harvesting intervals due to floods and harvester shortages.","Fertilizer Recommendation":"The estate should identify areas where EFB can and cannot be applied to consider inorganic fertilizer reduction. Proper frond stacking is recommended to enhance fertilizer efficacy. Fungicides should be applied alternately, not mixed. Water levels in collection drains should be managed between 75-100cm from the peat surface. Weeding operations for flood-prone areas should be scheduled strategically after floods."},"plantation":{"Executive Summary":"Juasa Estate (A & B) is undergoing replanting programs. The estate faces an acute shortage of sprayers and harvesters, impacting weeding and harvesting progress. Manuring programs experienced delays.

Yields declined in early 2025 due to seasonal factors.","Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring":"Manuring program for 2024 was 100% completed for both divisions. For 2025 (Jan-Apr), Timur is 33% complete and Kema is 37% complete. Fertilizer deliveries are on schedule, and sampling is conducted. Application quality is acceptable. Workers use buckets, but wheelbarrows are encouraged for better productivity.","Agronomic Observation":"Harvesting intervals are consistently maintained within 20 days. Crop recovery is acceptable with minimal losses and insignificant overripe bunches. Palm appearance is acceptable, but mild potassium deficiency symptoms are observed in some blocks (P06D2, P02B3, P09F2, P08G1, P08G3). Weed control is satisfactory, with good soft-grass cover and effective eradication of broadleaf/woody weeds. Rat infestation exceeded 10% in Kema division (P09F, P08G), but no baiting was conducted (Agronomy Report, Pg. 30). Barn owl occupancy is below expectations (Timur 64%, Kema 74%) (Agronomy Report, Pg. 32). Ganoderma infection is negligible, and no major bagworm infestations were found. Elephant attack signs are observed in P18H (Agronomy Report, Pg. 37).","Yield Performance":"The yield recorded for the year 2024 increased by 24.5% (Timur) and 23.1% (Kema) compared to the previous year, with many fields yielding over 20 mt/ha. The yield achieved for the four months this year was -19.5% (Timur) and -9.2% (Kema) lower than the same period of the previous year, likely caused by seasonal factors. Crop recovery was satisfactory with eight rounds of harvesting recorded as of April 2025. The crop loss was minimal.","Fertilizer Recommendation":"No amendments to the 2025 fertilizer program. The 2026 program will be drafted after field inspection which scheduled for second half this year. The estate should conduct a GPS palm census to determine actual palm stand for fertilizer requirements and Ganoderma status."},"plantation":{"Executive Summary":"Nuklias 6 Estate is fully mature with no replanting plans for 2025.

Road conditions are acceptable. Pruning is satisfactory, though thinning of super-tall palms is slow. Harvesting intervals are acceptable, and crop production and cost of production are satisfactory.","Area Statement":"The estate comprises 824.50 hectares of oil palm planted area (97.93%) and 17.39 hectares of unplanted area (2.07%). It is divided into Innomakmur (Kema) and Timur Divisions (412.70 ha and 411.80 ha respectively), both fully mature. No replanting is planned for 2025, as yields are expected to exceed 20 tons/ha.","Labour Statement":"The estate has a total of 56 workers (1:15 ha ratio, adequate), but a shortage of 4 harvesters (actual 1:23 ha vs required 1:21 ha).

Manuring for 2024 was completed, but 2025 progress is slow (only 6% completed as of Feb 2025). Weeding was delayed in 2024, leading to proliferation of specific weeds like Ageratum conyzoides. Pruning is satisfactory, but over-pruning occurred in one block (P06D5). Rat population is under control, but Ganoderma infection is significant, causing palm losses, with deboling and mounding performed. Roads are in bad condition due to heavy rainfall. Harvesting intervals are acceptable (13-20 days), but harvester productivity is low (2.0-2.3 MT/md), and income is below minimum wage. Crop production (20.16 MT/ha in 2024) and cost of production (RM 227.01/tonne FFB) are satisfactory.","Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring":"Manuring for 2024 was 100% completed. For 2025 (Jan-Feb), only 6% of the program is complete, with Compact B applied in P06D and P04B. Application quality is generally acceptable. Workers use buckets, and productivity is acceptable (26 bags/man-day), but income (RM 59.80) is below minimum wage. Wheelbarrows or semi-mechanized methods are encouraged. The cost of manuring in 2024 was RM 1,310.72 per hectare, which is 73% of the annual budget and acceptable.","Agronomic Observation":"Harvesting interval for H2 2024 ranged 13-20 days and was maintained at acceptable levels. Under-ripe bunches were detected in Block D3, requiring strengthened supervision. Palm appearance is acceptable, but localized areas show less vigor and orange spotting (potassium deficiency). Leaf N and P were suboptimal in 2024. Weed control in 2024 was delayed, with Ageratum conyzoides proliferation in palm circles (Agronomy Report, Pg. 24). Over-spraying was not detected. Pruning for 2024 was completed, but over-pruning occurred in P06D5 (Agronomy Report, Pg. 22). Pre-matured snapping fronds likely due to water stress. Rat population was under control (Dec 2024), but regular census is needed. Barn owl occupancy was 71%. No bagworm outbreaks. Ganoderma infection causes significant palm losses, with deboling and mounding performed (Agronomy Report, Pg. 31).","Yield Performance":"The average yield recorded in 2024 showed a 21.4% increase compared to the previous year (22.04 MT/ha), in line with regional trends. Monthly production has been declining since September 2024. Rainfall in 2024 was acceptable. The yield for 2025 is expected to be lower than the previous year. Nonetheless, the estate should ensure full crop recovery by maintaining desired harvesting intervals. Crop loss was minimal, and rat and bagworm infestations were minimal.","Fertilizer Recommendation":"The 2025 fertilizer program requires no revision. The 2026 program will be drafted after the second agronomy visit. Estate should prioritize accelerating inter-row weeding to control Ageratum conyzoides. Desilting in flood-prone areas is recommended for rapid water discharge. Encourage wheelbarrows/semi-mechanized methods for manuring.

The 2024 manuring program was completed on schedule, and preparations for 2025 fertilizer application are underway. Harvesting interval is slightly extended to 16-20 days, with over-ripe bunches detected. Canopy management is generally satisfactory, but premature frond snapping due to Ganoderma was observed. Palms exhibit acceptable vigor, though mild magnesium and potassium deficiencies were noted in localized areas, and nitrogen and phosphorus levels declined in P06A. Overgrown and persistent weeds (Clidemia hirta, Ageratum conyzoides, Solanum torvum) were observed in several blocks. Rat infestations are insignificant, and Ganoderma infection is being monitored.","Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring":"The manuring program for 2024 was fully completed without serious delay in application. The estate has not received any fertilizers for 2025 yet, but a delivery has been scheduled and is expected to arrive this week. The fertilizer store is ready to receive new consignments.","Agronomic Observation":"The harvesting interval for 2024 ranged from 16 to 20 days, and remains so in early January 2025 due to rain interference. A significant percentage of over-ripe bunches was detected in Blocks B1, B4, C2 and E3, and signs of extended harvesting intervals were detected in Field P11D3, requiring immediate action to prevent yield loss (Agronomy Report, Pg. 12). Loose fruit collection was satisfactory. There is a slight shortage of harvesters (24 available out of 28 required). Infield collection using Mechanical Badang (MB) achieved the highest productivity (9.29 MT/day) (Agronomy Report, Pg. 13). Pruning progress is up-to-date, with progressive pruning successfully implemented and acceptable canopy management standards (36-40 fronds). Premature snapping of fronds was observed in blocks P06A, P09B, and P10C, attributed to Ganoderma infection (Agronomy Report, Pg. 16). Palm vigor was generally acceptable, but some palms in laterite areas exhibited mild magnesium and potassium deficiency symptoms. Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus levels declined in P06A (Agronomy Report, Pg. 19-20). Water-logging conditions were not detected. Weeding program for 2024 was completed without significant delays except for P06A (70% for third round circle weeding). Patches of Clidemia hirta, Ageratum conyzoides, and Solanum torvum were observed (Agronomy Report, Pg. 21). Palm circle condition was generally acceptable, but debris and unwanted materials (frond butts) were found in blocks A2 and A3, affecting loose fruit collection (Agronomy Report, Pg. 22).","Yield Performance":"In 2024, the average yield increased significantly from 18.2 to 25.4 metric tons per hectare, reflecting an overall improvement of 39%, which is considered satisfactory. Notable individual increases in yield were observed across all fields. Most fields completed 21 harvesting rounds, slightly lower than the optimal benchmark of 24 harvesting rounds, indicating a shortfall of around three rounds.","Fertilizer Recommendation":"No amendment is made to the 2025 fertilizer program.

Yield performance for Jan-Feb 2025 is significantly lower due to seasonal factors, and road conditions are a concern for crop evacuation. Fertilizer recommendations remain unchanged.","Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring":"The 2024 manuring program was completed for Ladang Darabif, and 97% completed for Ladang Insan Jaya due to adverse weather and labor shortage. Delays of 3-5 months were observed in 2024. For 2025, Ladang Darabif is 17% complete and Ladang Insan Jaya is 8% complete as of Feb 2025, progressing slower than expected. Fertilizer delivery is also slower than scheduled. Application quality needs improvement (narrow and lumpy application observed). The fertilizer store is acceptable.","Agronomic Observations (Ladang Insan Jaya)":"Harvesting intervals are mostly exceeding 20 days (e.g., PM03C: 23 days, PM14F: 22-28 days, PM15G: 24-27 days), leading to significant over-ripe and rotten bunches (P15G-01, P15G-02). FFB were left overnight in P15G-04. Loose fruit collection is generally acceptable but oxidized loose fruit found in hilly areas. Palm appearance is acceptable, but retarded growth and small bunch formation observed in laterite areas and areas previously overgrown by weeds (P15G-03). Pruning is progressing well in 2025, but under-pruning was observed in PM03C-01. Pre-mature frond snapping in PM05E-01 and PM05E-02. Frond heap management is inconsistent. Weeding program is behind schedule for circle spraying, with over-spraying in E02 and G01. Undesirable weeds (Giant Paspalum, Clidemia hirta, Bamboo, woody vegetation, Stenochlaena, Bracken ferns, VOPs) are present. Rat damage is minimal, but a full census is needed. Ganoderma symptoms (frond snapping, fallen palms) in E01, requiring deboling. No leaf-eating pest infestations.","Agronomic Observations (Ladang Darabif)":"Harvesting intervals are extended in most blocks (e.g., PM03A: 20-39 days, PM03B: 19-28 days). Crop quality is unsatisfactory with under-ripe and significant over-ripe/unfresh bunches observed. Palm appearance is generally acceptable, but less vigor in flood-prone D3. Pruning progress for 2025 is not yet reported (as of Feb), with slight under-pruning in C01, A02, D02, and pre-matured frond snapping in A1, D1. Inconsistent frond stacking in D1, A3. Roadside pruning is needed in D1 due to poor road conditions. Inter-row spraying is progressing well, but circle weeding is slower than expected. VOPs and Epiphytes need eradication. Rat infestation is minimal, but a new census is needed. Ganoderma infection remains under control, but new fallen palms need deboling.","Yield Performance":"Yields in 2024 were significantly higher than the previous year for both estates (Darabif: 18.61 MT/ha vs 23.64 MT/ha in 2023; Insan Jaya: 20.06 MT/ha vs 22.34 MT/ha in 2023).

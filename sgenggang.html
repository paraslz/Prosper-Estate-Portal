                        "Executive Summary": "The estate faces a critical labour shortage crisis that is severely impacting operations. The shortage of harvesters and sprayers has caused significant crop loss and delays in upkeep programs. While FFB yield is 22% below budget, costs remain well controlled (underspent by 30% in General Charges). On a positive note, the manuring program is nearly complete. Immediate recruitment is vital to restore the harvester ratio and normalize harvesting intervals. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 53)",
                        "Area Statement": "The total planted area stands at 2,809.16 ha. The Mature area has been reduced to 2,163.31 ha due to ongoing replanting activities. The Immature area currently spans 645.85 ha, comprising recent replants (PR23/I, PR24/J, PR25/K). Management has confirmed that no new replanting is planned for the upcoming 2026 fiscal year. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 9)",
                        "Labour Statement": "The labor situation is critical. The estate requires 171 workers but currently operates with only 120, resulting in a shortage of 41 pax (24% vacancy). Specifically, there is a shortage of 24 harvesters and 11 sprayers. The current harvester-to-land ratio has deteriorated to 1:31 ha, far exceeding the target of 1:23 ha. Recruitment of 16 new harvesters is expected by mid-December. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 10)",
                        "Staff Establishment": "The staff complement is generally satisfactory and sufficient to manage current operations. However, there is a notable vacancy for one Assistant Manager position which needs to be filled to ensure adequate supervision across all divisions. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 12)",
                        "General Charges": "General Charges are well managed, showing a 30% underspend as of September. However, it is noted that the Pinfosys report for October was delayed, which may affect the final year-end projection. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 13)",
                        "Upkeep & Cultivation": "Field upkeep shows mixed results due to labor constraints. Manuring is a highlight, with 98% of the program completed satisfactorily. Conversely, Circle Weeding is lagging at 87% completion due to the sprayer shortage; the use of Controlled Droplet Application (CDA) is strongly recommended to improve coverage. Pruning is critically behind schedule at only 50% completion, leading to sanitation issues. EFB application is 63% complete but hampered by field access issues. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 14-25)",
                        "Harvesting and Collection": "Harvesting performance is poor, primarily driven by the severe harvester shortage. The estate achieved only 13.5 harvesting rounds against a budget of 18 rounds. Consequently, harvesting intervals have drifted to 23 days in December, leading to high loose fruit wastage and crop loss. Harvester productivity is currently low as new recruits are still acclimatizing. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 35-39)",
                        "Crop Production": "Production is significantly below target. YTD September Yield stands at 11.55 MT/ha against a budget of 14.88 MT/ha, representing a negative variance of 22%. When compared to the same period last year (14.12 MT/ha), the yield has dropped by 18%, emphasizing the impact of the labor shortage. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 38)",
                        "Production Cost": "Despite the operational challenges, costs are relatively controlled. The Total Upkeep & Harvesting Cost is RM 190.24/MT (Actual) versus the budgeted RM 184.13/MT. While the cost per tonne is slightly higher than budget, the overall absolute expenditure is lower due to uncompleted field works. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 40)",
                        "Vehicles Running Cost": "Vehicle running costs are underspent and remain well within the approved budget. No major overspending or mechanical issues were highlighted in this period. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 51)",
                        "Capital Expenditure": "Capital Expenditure is significantly underspent, with RM 678k utilized against a budget of RM 905k. This indicates deferred projects or cost savings in procurement. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 52)",
                        "Immature (PR23/I, PR24/J, PR25/K)": "Immature fields show varying progress. PR23/I is performing well with 83% weeding and 80% manuring completion; fruit set is good. PR24/J has achieved 100% manuring completion, though weeding is at 78% and requires Volunteer Oil Palm (VOP) eradication. The new planting, PR25/K (134 ha planted), is facing challenges with delayed blanket spraying due to the sprayer shortage. (Source: PA Report 2/2025, Pg. 41-50)"

The estate continues to struggle with a harvester shortage (22% deficit), leading to intervals exceeding 20 days. Manuring progress is good (97%), but storage conditions require immediate improvement. Pruning in old mature fields is critically behind schedule (40%). (Source: Agronomy Report 2/2025, Pg. 2-7)",
                        "Nutrient Inputs & Manuring": "Manuring is 97% complete (Nov 2025). Old stock Compact B has been cleared. However, fertilizer bags were found stored directly on wet ground; usage of pallets is mandatory. EFB application covers 73% of the area but is often placed too close to palm bases.

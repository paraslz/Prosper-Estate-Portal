A significant issue is the acute shortage of harvesters, leading to incomplete crop recovery and extended harvesting intervals. Yield as of June 2025 is significantly lower than the previous year. Urgent attention is needed to address the worker shortage. (Agronomy Report, Pg. 58-59)",
                        "Nutrient Inputs/Progress of Manuring": "Manuring in 2024 was completed with delays. As of June 2025, the program is only 50% complete and has fallen behind schedule, particularly for Mixture B, Rock Phosphate, and compound applications in various blocks. (Agronomy Report, Pg. 12-14)",
                        "Agronomic Observation": "Crop recovery is a major issue in older plantings (P97, P99, P13) due to difficult terrain, under-pruning, and poor roads. Harvesting intervals have exceeded 20 days in some areas. Pruning and weeding are also behind schedule. Palm vigor in P13 is poor. Pest and disease levels are currently insignificant. (Agronomy Report, Pg. 15-31)",

However, critical shortages of harvesters and sprayers persist, leading to delays in pruning and weeding. Sprayer productivity is unacceptably low. Ganoderma and cattle intrusion are ongoing issues. The focus should be on resolving labor shortages and improving productivity. (PA Report, Pg. 50-52)",

Sprayer productivity is very low (1.5 ha/day) and requires investigation. The manuring program for 2024 was fully completed. (PA Report, Pg. 15-26)",
                        "Harvesting and Collection": "Harvesting interval averaged 18 days. Productivity is low in older blocks (P97A, P99B, P13F) due to tall palms and poor access. Harvester earnings are below the basic wage in these blocks. (PA Report, Pg. 35-37)",
                        "Crop Production": "Oil palm yield in 2024 was 20.15 t/ha, a 65% increase from 2023 and 6% above budget. Rubber yield was 927 kg/ha, 18% higher than 2023 but 34% below budget. (PA Report, Pg. 35, 38)",

(Agronomy Report, Pg. 12-14)","Agronomic Observation":"Crop recovery is a major issue in older plantings (P97, P99, P13) due to difficult terrain, under-pruning, and poor roads. Harvesting intervals have exceeded 20 days in some areas. Pruning and weeding are also behind schedule. Palm vigor in P13 is poor. Pest and disease levels are currently insignificant.
